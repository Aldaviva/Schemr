# About
Schemr allows you to quickly select your color scheme from the command palette, as well as providing key bindings to easily cycle forward and backward through your color schemes.

# Installation
Install Schemr through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) or download and extract it into your Packages folder.

# Usage
Select "Schemr: List schemes" from the command palette to bring up the available schemes. Default binding: `ctrl+alt+f5` (Windows/Linux) `super+alt+f5` (OSX)

The "Schemr: Next scheme" `ctrl+alt+f7` (Windows/Linux) `super+alt+f7` (OSX) command will skip to the next scheme available.

The "Schemr: Previous scheme" `ctrl+alt+f8` (Windows/Linux) `super+alt+f8` (OSX)command will skip to the previous scheme available.

# Sublime Text 3 compatibility
ST3 support is limited to `.tmTheme` files located in your `/Packages/` directory. Schemes saved as `.sublime-package` files (such as through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)) in the `/Installed Packages/` directory are not yet supported.

Temporary workaround: unzip the `.sublime-package` file to a folder in the `/Packages/` directory.
